    "<img src=\"static_images/icons/noun-answer-3361020.png\" alt=\">\" style=\"width:25px\"/>  __Answer:__ Depth and Accuracy: ResNet-18 is a relatively deep neural network with 18 layers. Initial Convolutional Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with a series of convolutional layers, gradually increasing the number of output channels (or filters) from 64 to 512. Each convolutional layer is followed by batch normalization to stabilize training and improve convergence.\n",
    "Reasoning: These layers act as feature extractors, capturing low-level features in the input image. Batch normalization helps with faster training and better convergence.\n",
    "ReLU Activation and MaxPooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "After each convolutional layer, you apply the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity. This helps capture complex patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "Max pooling is applied after every two convolutional layers. It reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while retaining important information.\n",
    "Reasoning: ReLU introduces non-linearity, which is crucial for capturing complex data patterns. Max pooling reduces the spatial dimensions, making the network more robust to variations in object position and size.\n",
    "Adaptive Average Pooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Added an adaptive average pooling layer after the convolutional layers. This layer automatically adapts the size of the output feature map to a predefined size (in this case, 1x1). It computes the average value of each channel's feature map, effectively summarizing the spatial information.\n",
    "Reasoning: Adaptive average pooling ensures that the network is invariant to the input image's spatial size, making the model more translation-invariant and reducing overfitting.\n",
    "Flatten Layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "You use a flatten layer to reshape the 3D tensor from the adaptive average pooling into a 2D tensor, preparing it for the fully connected layers.\n",
    "Reasoning: Flattening the tensor is necessary before passing it through fully connected layers.\n",
    "Fully Connected Classifier:\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier consists of two fully connected (linear) layers. The first reduces the dimensionality from 512 to 256, followed by a ReLU activation. The final linear layer produces the output logits for classification.\n",
    "Reasoning: The fully connected layers perform the final decision-making based on the high-level features extracted by the convolutional layers and adapted by the pooling layers. The ReLU activation introduces non-linearity.\n",
    "Dropout:\n",
    "\n",
    "I have incorporated dropout layers with a dropout probability of 0.5 after the flatten layer and after the first fully connected layer.\n",
    "Reasoning: Dropout helps prevent overfitting by randomly dropping a fraction of units during training, forcing the network to learn more robust features.\n",
    "In summary, the architecture design follows best practices for building a deep convolutional neural network. It starts with convolutional and pooling layers to extract hierarchical features, incorporates batch normalization for stability, uses adaptive average pooling to summarize spatial information, and ends with fully connected layers for classification. Dropout is applied for regularization. This architecture is suitable for various image classification tasks as it captures both low-level and high-level features while being robust to variations in object position and scale."
